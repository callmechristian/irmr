## WARNING: SCRIPTS AND GRAPHS ARE INTENDED FOR AN OLD VERSION OF MEDIAPIPE[^1]
# Hand Gesture Recognition and Infrared Information System
Hand gesture recognition to infrared signals on Raspberry Pi 4B

## Getting mediapipe to work on Rapsberry Pi
Check [mediapipe.dev](https://mediapipe.dev/) first for the latest version and see if there's a better way to do this. Otherwise my rough guide can be found [here](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/issues/225#issuecomment-648751146). [^2]
[^1]:(cca. Nov. 2019) use at your own risk
[^2]:this is the only thing that worked in my case, but it takes a long time so maybe try other guides first
